- [x] Implement FileContents helper.
- [x] Implement TTL helper.
- [x] Use tox to test multiple environments.
- [x] Write tutorial.
- [x] Clean up theory.
- [x] Thread safety.
- [x] Make `MemoizedGroup` picklable.
- [x] Fix `determ_hash(numpy.inte64(1234))`
- [x] Test usage in parallel environments.
- [x] Fix `time_cost`.

- [ ] Last resort, fall back on __hash__
- [ ] Test for repeated use of multiprocessing
  - setstate clears version and reads cache
- [ ] Test for f(x), write, read, f.would_hit(x)
  - Index.__setitem__ doesn't delete if last_level[last_key] = val
- [ ] Fix stepping on each others toes.
- [ ] Found in index but not in obj_store
- [ ] Remove orphans optional
- [ ] Print log on {invalidation, eviction, orphan, miss, hit}
  - Handle long arg message
  - Humanize timedeltas
  - Print what part of key is invalidated
- [ ] Catch Pickle TypeError
- [x] Test that Memoized functions compose
  - Write __determ_hash__ for memoized
- [ ] Can't assume object is available while deserializing?

- [ ] Do away with hashable. Just use determ_hash
  - Hash a module by its contents (like an object).
- [ ] Use xxHash
- [ ] Support fastpath for hashing numpy arrays and pandas df
- [ ] Hashable prints log on error
- [ ] Content address object store or use hash(index keys)
  - This recovers orphans automatically
  - This makes the object-key deterministic, so if two parallel workers compute the same object, only one gets stored.
  - Requires writes to be atomic
- [ ] Make ch_time_block serializable
- [ ] file-IO based pickle
- [ ] Make fine_grain* apply to a Memoized level. All benefit from positive externalities.

- [ ] Reset stats
- [ ] Implement GitHub actions
  - Use code quality/anlaysis services (codacy, codeclimate, coverity, coveralls, sonarqube)
- [ ] Add "button" images to README.
  - GitHub Actions checks
  - External code quality/analysis
- [ ] Make working example of caching in S3.
- [ ] Set up git-changelog.
- [ ] Make resistant to errors
  - Add commit()
  - sys.excepthook
- [ ] Optionally repay stdout on cache hit
- [ ] Fix frozendict
